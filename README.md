# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is an app I wrote mainly for practice to learn more about swift and iOS development.

I've been using Rob Percival's course called: "The Complete iOS8 and Swift Course: Learn By Building 15 Real World Apps" on Udemy.com to learn more about iOS development. 
I relied heavily on using Lecture 65 to help me with this specific app.

It's not complete and doesn't look very pretty but it did help me learn about inserting pictures in a Storyboard and controlling them using code in the ViewController.

Later I might try to add more features to it. The biggest problem with it is that it doesn't have an option if two players end the game in a draw.
It works but for now I'm going to leave it and continue watching the lectures and learning other aspects about Swift and making apps.
